# openshift-f5-env-setup
Setup connectivity between the OpenShift ramp node and F5 BIGIP router 


Setup F5 BIGIP Host:
--------------------
To setup the F5 BIGIP host connectivity to the OpenShift cluster, you need the IP address of the node that
you have designated to be the OpenShift Cluster's ramp node and then just run:

    $ sudo ./setup-f5-sdn  <ramp-node-ip-address>    
    $ #  E.g.sudo ./setup-f5-sdn  10.3.89.191
    

Setup OpenShift Ramp Node:
--------------------------
To setup the ramp node as a bridge connecting the OpenShift cluster and
the F5 BIGIP host, you need the IP address of the F5 node's internal
interface.

    $ sudo ./setup-ramp-node-sdn  <f5-host-internal-ip>
    $ # E.g. sudo ./setup-ramp-node-sdn  10.3.89.235
