#  Usage:  setup-f5-sdn  <RAMP-NODE-IP>  [ <F5-IP> ]
#            where:  <RAMP-NODE-IP>  is the IP address of the ramp node.
#                    <F5-IP>         is the IP address of the internal
#                                    interface of the F5 router.
#
#  Examples:
#    ./setup-f5-sdn 10.3.89.191
#        where: 10.3.89.191 is the IP address of the ramp node.
#
#    ./setup-f5-sdn 10.3.89.191 10.3.89.235
#        where:  10.3.89.191 is the IP address of the ramp node.
#                10.3.89.235 is the IP address of the internal interface of
#                            the F5 router. You can get this via:
#                              ip -o -4 addr list internal |  \
#                                awk '{print $4}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -n 1
